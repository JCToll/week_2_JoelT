    <h1>The Cornerstones of My Heritage</h1>
    <p>Often when people meet me, they ask, "Where are you from?" Such a simple question... and yet, I always hesitate to answer - it's complicated.   </p>
    <p>I start by stating, "...well, I was born and grew up in Brazil - ", and I get no further when I am interrupted with, "What? No way!  With a name like Tollefson, <i>how can you be Brazilian?</i>" </p>
    <p>And then it starts... I explain that actually, my grandparents are from Norway, my parents grew up in Seattle, but moved to Brazil where I was born. I then returned to Seattle for college where I have since lived.  It get's complicated.  </p>
    <b>Norway, USA</b>, and <b>Brazil</b> are the cornerstones of my heritage. Just as a cornerstone defines the foundation that joins walls, these countries are the cornerstones that join my heritage. These cornerstones define who I am.
