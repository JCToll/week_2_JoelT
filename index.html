    <h1>The Cornerstones of My Heritage</h1>
    <p>Often when people meet me, they ask, "Where are you from?" Such a simple question... and yet, I always hesitate to answer - it's complicated.   </p>
    <p>I start by stating, "...well, I was born and grew up in Brazil - ", and I get no further when I am interrupted with, "What? No way!  With a name like Tollefson, <i>how can you be Brazilian?</i>" </p>
    <p>And then it starts... I explain that actually, my grandparents are from Norway, my parents grew up in Seattle, but moved to Brazil where I was born. I then returned to Seattle for college where I have since lived.  It get's complicated.  </p>
    <b>Norway, USA</b>, and <b>Brazil</b> are the cornerstones of my heritage. Just as a cornerstone defines the foundation that joins walls, these countries are the cornerstones that join my heritage. These cornerstones define who I am.

          <h2>Andøya, Norway - The first Conerstone </h2>
          <p><i>Why is Andøya an important conerstone of my heritage?</i></p>
        </header> 

        <p>My heritage starts with my maternal grandparents, who were born and grew up on opposite ends of the small island of Andøya, Norway. My grandpa Hjalmar said that as a young boy, he met my grandma Agnes only one time when their two churches joined for the final Confirmation ceremony. He vowed he would someday marry that girl... but then he never saw here again. </p>
        <p>My grandparents both immigrated separately to the United States in early the 1920's. Neither knew that the other had also immigrated.  One day, by sheer coincidence, they bumped into each other on a trolley in the city of Tacoma. They were soon married and settled in Ballard, Seattle. The rest is history...  </p>
